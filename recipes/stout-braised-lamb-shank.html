    <h4>How to Make Stout Braised Lamb Shank Step-By-Step</h4>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven or large, wide pot over medium-high heat until oil begins to smoke. Sear lamb shanks in hot oil on all sides until browned, about 10 minutes. Remove lamb shanks and set aside. Drain excess grease..</li>
        <li>Add onion and garlic to the Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir until onion is softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in carrots, celery, and tomato paste; cook for 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Return lamb shanks to the Dutch oven and pour in broth and stout beer. Use kitchen twine to tie together thyme, parsley, and bay leaf into a secure bundle; add to lamb shanks. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until lamb is tender and nearly falls off the bone, 2 to 3 hours. Stir in rosemary sprig and season with salt and pepper during the last 10 minutes of cooking. Remove rosemary sprig and herb bundle before serving.</li>
        
    </ol>
